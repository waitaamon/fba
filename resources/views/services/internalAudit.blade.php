                                In today’s rapid environment businesses need to understand the environment in which they operate in, as well as any risks they face so as to manage such risks. Businesses need Internal audit to help them achieve their objectives. Internal audit is concerned with evaluating and improving the effectiveness of risk management, control and governance processes in an organization. An organization with a strong internal audit function – be it internal or outsourced – enjoys the perks of risks being identified and addressed in time if not real time.

                                The purpose of carrying out an IT audit on an organization’s Information Technology infrastructure is to ensure that the components of technological infrastructure do not allow controls within the business system to be circumvented and to provide a robust platform sufficient for the effective operation of the business application system. Our approach to ICT audits focuses on controls implemented around two broad domains: (a). General and Infrastructure controls and (b). Application Controls.

                                A key win to successful ICT audit is to employ the right methodology which focus on processes, technology and people related controls. We shall consider this when undertaking the ICT audit  with significant focus on the below key areas:
